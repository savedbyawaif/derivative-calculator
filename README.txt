Program Guide:
The purpose of this program is to accurately derive functions with respect to a derivation variable from user input. To start, the user will enter one alphanumeric character they would like to use as their derivation variable, then enter their function when prompted. Do not include any equals signs within the function input (example: Please enter your expression: sin(2*x)). The user is able to utilise product and quotient rule, however functions must be put in parenthesis (). Common functions sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot, arcsin, acrccos, actan, ln, and sqrt are able to function in the calculator. Some sample functions which may be used are: cos^2(2*y^2+y+2), sin(cos(sin(x))), (x*2)*sin(cos(2*x)), 2*x+sqrt(2)+2*x.
